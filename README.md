# Haberman-Survival-Dataset-EDA

Performed uni-variate analysis (histogram, pdf, cdf, box-plots, violin plots) and multi-variate analysis (pair-plots, contour plots and scatter plots) on all features.

**Conclusions**
-The given dataset is imbalanced. There were more patients who died than who surivived (almost 3:1).
-No two features are making the two classes linearly separable. There is high overlap between every pair of feature.
-Nodes values was giving the most information about the two classes. nodes values of patient was most important feaure for classifying patients between 2 classes. -Patients those who had 0 nodes has a very high chance of survival. As number of nodes values increases, chances for survival drops sharply.
